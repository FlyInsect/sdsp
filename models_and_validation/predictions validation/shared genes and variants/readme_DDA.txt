DisGeNET包含两种disease-disease association 数据：

1、Curated disease-disease associations
The file contains the disease-disease associations (DDAs) computed for 
curated sources (UNIPROT, CGI, ClinGen, Genomics England, CTD (human subset), PsyGeNET, and Orphanet). 
For each DDA we provide the number of shared genes, shared variants, and a Jaccard Index (JI). 

2、ALL disease-disease associations
The file contains the disease-disease associations (DDAs) computed for 
all sources in DisGeNET. 
For each DDA we provide the number of shared genes, shared variants, and a Jaccard Index (JI).
