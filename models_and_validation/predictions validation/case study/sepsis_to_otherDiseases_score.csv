Eosinophilic Granuloma,0.995,嗜酸性肉芽肿,(27441846)肉芽肿是一种免疫细胞的集合，被认为在传染病中具有保护作用。通过测定严重脓毒症患者的体外肉芽肿形成来监测免疫反应可能是个体化治疗的关键。肉芽肿形成的缺陷可能是严重脓毒症患者单核细胞和淋巴细胞募集和活化改变的一个指标。,
Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw,0.99471384,双膦酸盐相关性颌骨骨坏死,,
Hematuria,0.99392664,血尿,(25854772)导致运动性蛋白尿的因素可能包括血管变化、缺氧、乳酸积累、氧化应激、激素变化和败血症。,（32434806）COVID-19患者中有多达29%的急性肾损伤。报告的危险因素包括基线血清肌酐升高、血尿素氮升高、急性肾损伤、蛋白尿和血尿。疑似原因包括肾灌注不足引起的脓毒症和急性肾小管坏死、细胞因子释放综合征、病毒直接侵入、继发于肺泡损伤的肾髓质缺氧、横纹肌溶解症和病毒性心肌炎引起的心肾综合征。
"Granuloma, Giant Cell",0.9927899,巨细胞肉芽肿,（32411623）肉芽肿是免疫系统对侵袭作出反应时在组织中形成的致密结构。利用循环单核细胞体外形成肉芽肿是一种易于评估患者免疫反应的创新方法。监测患者的单核细胞在体外形成肉芽肿的效率将有助于改善他们的治疗管理。23名老年脓毒症患者和24名老年对照患者的循环单核细胞与涂有卡介苗或贝氏柯克斯体提取物的Sepharose珠孵育。,
"Empyema, Pleural",0.9923637,胸膜脓胸,(32303484)肺炎或胸膜脓胸是Lemierre综合征最常见的转移性感染。,(30345134)甲型流感病毒感染后化脓性链球菌引起的脓毒症和胸膜脓胸
"Empyema, Tuberculous",0.99219906,结核性脓胸,(14665781)Case Reports:一位粟粒性结核患者，他迅速发展成急性结核性脓胸。她经历了剧烈的病程，最终导致ARDS、败血症和随后的死亡。,
AIDS-Associated Nephropathy,0.9897084,艾滋病相关性肾病,(16392292)HIV（人类免疫缺陷病毒）感染患者可能面临多种肾脏问题模式。急性肾功能衰竭很常见，最常见的原因是败血症、高血压和有毒药物。,
Dental Pulp Necrosis,0.9884386,牙髓坏死,（17546858）牙髓最初对刺激的反应是发炎，如果不治疗，这将发展为牙髓坏死和感染。炎症也会扩散到周围的牙槽骨，引起根尖周病变。牙髓相关问题的严重程度不应低估，因为其最严重的后果是口腔脓毒症，可能危及生命,
